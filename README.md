# Smart Electric-Water-Heater
 
âž¢  A heater system using atmega32 and proteus simulation. I used scheduler technique to match
    time constraints required in this project. I had implemented many drivers like : Ex_EEPROM,
    I2C, two 7seg using multiplexing, LM35 using ADC, External interrupts and more.
